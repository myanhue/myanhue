## Myan's Portfolio
Currently studying and expanding my knowledge on security and network, as well as currently working on a keylogger project.
## Professional Statements
Hi, I'm Myan! I have a deep interest and love for technology and cybersecurity, which started when I was in middle school trying to figure out how to set up "port-forwarding" to open a Minecraft server for me and my friends. I've had my fair share of unfortunate experiences with malware when I was younger, which fuels my passion for security and learning how to effectively protect systems of my own. I'm currently studying for my CompTIA certificates.

Thank you for taking a look around at my portfolio!
